  When creating my Datawrapper chart I decided to work on the dataset I found including
  all confirmed hate crime incidents in New York City recorded by the NYPD from 2019 to 2022.
  With this information I was able to find out and display on my datawrapper which groups were victimized the most over the past
  three years. Here is where I made a grouped bars chart to be able to show the numbers of hate crimes recorded attacking each religion 
  since 2019. In more detail I decided to make each religion a differently colored bar with the Jewish population being 
  red to not only show the amount of crimes targeting them but also because I believe that red is a color of danger and warning.
  I decided to take this whole image a step further when I made my dataviz. Here I still included a bar chart but I had the “COEXIST”
  logo melting into the numbers of hate crimes representing religions as a sign of not only irony but 
  also as a sign of failure to follow this belief for those who have committed such crimes. Just like in the logo each 
  letter of the “COEXIST” represented a different religion. If I were to edit this differently in the
  future I would dive deeper into figuring out the labeling problem I have on my datawrapper. 
  As you can see the left column of my datawrapper isn’t labeled and I tried for so long to be able 
  to get it to be labeled but was unsuccessful.
