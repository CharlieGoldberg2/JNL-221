	"Donald Trump pleaded not guilty Tuesday to 34 counts of falsifying business records, in the first-ever criminal arraignment of a former U.S. president. 

Trump surrendered at a New York courthouse and then was arraigned on charges related to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s hush money payment probe. Trump exited the courthouse shortly before 3:30 p.m. ET and flew home to his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.<p>

Trump is not due back in court until December, according to NBC News.
He was indicted Thursday, and the charges were unsealed during the arraignment Tuesday. The 34 felony counts relate to his alleged role in a scheme that directed hush money payments to two women during the 2016 election. <p>

Trump’s former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen is known to have facilitated payments to two women in order to keep them silent about alleged affairs with Trump: former adult film star Stormy Daniels and ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal." Trump appeared before acting New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan on Tuesday. Photos from the courtroom showed a deflated Trump sitting among his legal team. The ex-president, meanwhile, plans to travel back to his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida after the hearing and deliver remarks there. Trump denies the claim by Daniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, that she had sex with him one time in 2006. He also denies wrongdoing related to the $130,000 payment Cohen gave her to keep quiet about the alleged tryst. <p>

	Trump said he did not commit crimes in New York — and denied wrongdoing in three other criminal investigations hanging over his bid to reclaim the White House next year. “The only crime I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from those who seek to destroy it,” the former president told supporters at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida hours after pleading not guilty to 34 felony counts at a Manhattan courthouse. <p>

Early in his remarks, Trump painted himself as a victim of long-running schemes to discredit him for political gain. Trump jumped between grievances in a campaign-style speech, attacking Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and other major officials leading criminal or civil probes of his conduct: Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and New York Attorney General Letitia James. <p>

The ex-president drilled into familiar foes in his 2016 presidential opponent Hillary Clinton and President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter. He also repeated the conspiracy theory that widespread fraud led to his 2020 election loss against Biden, and made unfounded claims that the U.S. economy is on the brink of collapse.In assessing the Manhattan charges, Trump noted that Bragg may have trouble proving his case — a view expressed by some legal experts outside of Trump’s orbit.  <p>

	Acting New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan, who presided over Trump’s arraignment, ruled the former president will have to attend his Dec. 4 pretrial hearing in person for now, according to NBC News. His decision on the matter could change.Trump’s defense team argued the cost and effort involved with securing Manhattan for Trump’s court appearance justifies allowing him not to appear in person. <p>

	Trump will speak from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida hours after he pleaded not guilty at his arraignment in New York.Trump has in recent days repeatedly lashed out at Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and claimed his office’s charges against Trump are politically motivated. The ex-president has denied wrongdoing.

    	Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg unveiled new details about the role the National Enquirer’s then-publisher played in boosting former President Donald Trump’s winning 2016 campaign.

Bragg alleges within his statement of facts that AMI, which was run at the time by Trump ally David Pecker, had an extensive role in helping the former president beyond just suppressing negative stories about him — including ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal’s allegation that she had an affair with Trump.

At a meeting in Trump Tower in August 2015, months after Trump declared his candidacy for president, Pecker “agreed to help with the Defendant’s campaign, saying that he would act as the ‘eyes and ears’ for the campaign by looking out for negative stories about the Defendant and alerting Lawyer A before the stories were published,” Bragg’s office said. Pecker allegedly said at the time that he would also “publish negative stories about the Defendant’s competitors for the election,” according to the DA.

The alliance among Trump, AMI and Pecker continued through the 2016 election and the former president’s inauguration, according to Bragg’s investigation. The probe revealed that after the company and Pecker helped Trump, he invited the then-media CEO to the inauguration and, later in 2017, to the White House.
